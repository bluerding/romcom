# RomCom  

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
We built a site that lets a user generate a random romantic comedy book cover, giving it a different picture, title, and description every time. The site can also allow the user to input their own pictures, titles, and descriptors to make their own custom romantic comedy book. The user can also save their favorite covers. The purpose of the site is entertainment and user interaction.

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)
The site is live at https://bluerding.github.io/romcom/ 

### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)

We enjoyed being able to create whatever book you wanted!

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
For this project we worked approximately 30 hours. We have completed two weeks of Mod 1.

### Contributors:
[//]: <> (Who worked on this application? Link to their GitHubs.)

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
Learning goals were to write clean, DRY JavaScript, to explore the connection between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and to write code collaboratively. We worked with VSCode and github.
### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
Wins:
- We feel that getting the hang of the github workflow was a win
- We set up norms in the beginning and stuck to them throughout the duration of the project
- We did well with pseucoding and doing that collaboratively.
    - https://www.notion.so/Ben-Carol-RomCom-Project-fcd0acb73c6a4d82b5e4bc7a722ffcab
- We think it was a win that we were able to understand all of the concepts we used for this project. We can understand and explain the code that we wrote.
- Carol had a win when she was able to recognize how the mini cover class in CSS worked with the HTML, so we were able to use that to change the sizes of our saved covers

Challenges:
- For Ben, the time dedication is a huge challenge
- A challenge we had was finding documentation. We found the online resources confusing. We reached out to other people in our cohort and Turing to help us understand how to build functionalities within the project.
- It is still a challenge to try to teach ourselves new concepts and material by looking at documentation and online resources.
